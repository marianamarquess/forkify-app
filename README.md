# Forkify Project

Forkify is a recipe search application that allows users to explore a collection of recipes fetched from an external API. With Forkify, users can also add and bookmark their own recipes, which are securely stored locally on their devices. This project was developed following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) framework, as part of a JavaScript Udemy course (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).

## Features

* Recipe Search: Explore a wide range of recipes by searching through the extensive recipe database.
* Bookmark Recipes: Users can save their favorite recipes as bookmarks for quick access.
* Local Storage: All user-created recipes and bookmarks are securely stored locally on the user's device.
* User-Friendly Interface: The application offers an intuitive and visually appealing interface for seamless recipe discovery and management.
